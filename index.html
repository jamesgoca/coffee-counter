						<td>Latte</td>
						<td>☕️☕️☕️☕️</td>
						<td>Very hot when initially served, took a little while to cool down. When it was cooled down, it was delicious. Perhaps the best latte I have had without almond milk. The art was the best I have ever seen. The cup was simple but paired with the coffee well.</td>

						<td>Flat White</td>
						<td>☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️</td>
						<td>The best coffee I have ever had. A tad too warm when served, every sip was delicious. The scent of the coffee was strong and enciting. The drink was smooth and silky with bitter tones. The coffee was bold and strong. Swishing it around in my mouth released a somewhat nutty flavor. Deep, bold, delicious.</td>

					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Cold Brew</td>
						<td>☕️☕️☕️☕️</td>
						<td>Slightly bitter taste, reminds me of the Costa cold brew, good balance of milk and coffee, would opt for more ice cubes next time, should stir for one full minute and use a timer. Goes well even on a slightly cooler day. Smooth. Cafe Direct (3) blend.</td>
						<td>2020-08-13</td>

						<td>☕️☕️☕️☕️</td>

						<td>Cappuccino</td>
						<td>☕️☕️☕️☕️</td>

						<td>Cold Brew</td>

						<td>Black Coffee</td>
						<td>☕️☕️☕️☕️</td>
						<td>Aroma reminds me somewhat of the Revelation Blend by Union Coffee (Damascus Drum)

Longer brew time makes the coffee stronger and more flavorful

Notes of chocolate, dark, Earthy aroma

A little bit bright, bold, makes me feel happier, sun shining through the clouds</td>

					<tr>
						<td>Black Coffee</td>
						<td>☕️☕️☕️</td>
						<td>Forgot to set timer, brewed for about 1:00-1:15

Slurping brings out the flavor, Earthy and bright

Nut flavor, peanut, creamy flavor

Notes of dar chocolate, sweetness

More bitter ending. I did not apply the filter paper properly and some beans got through. I should make sure that the filter is flat before I brew. I noticed a small ridge but I did not fix it.

Frutiness
